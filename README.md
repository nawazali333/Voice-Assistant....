# Voice-Assistant....

Have you ever wondered how cool it would be if you had your own virtual A.I. assistant ( just like J.A.R.V.I.S), 
imagine how easier it would be to send emails without typing a single word, searching on Wikipedia without actually opening the web browsers,
and performing many other daily tasks with the help of a single voice command.
